# Tic-Tac-Toe
TIC-TAC-TOE AI

Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe
against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with
or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable.
This project will help you understand game theory and basic search algorithms.

This code defines the TicTacToe class with methods for playing the game, and the minimax function implements the AI player using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning. The play_game function handles the game loop where the AI plays against the human player.
